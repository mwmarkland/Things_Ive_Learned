## Chess Rules from the Lourdes Chess Club
### Ten Rules for Opening
The basic idea in the opening is to develop quickly and get control of the center.

1. Open with d-pawn or e-pawn.
2. Wherever possible make a good developing move wich threatens something.
3. Develop knights before bishops.
4. Pick the most suitable square for a piece and developer it there once and for all.
5. Make one or two pawn moves in the opening, not more.
6. Do not bring your Queen out early.
7. Castle as soon as possible, preferably on the King's side.
8. Play to get control of the center.
9. Always try to maintain at least one pawn in the center.
10. Do not sacrifice with a clear and adequate reason.

### Ten Rules for the Middle Game
1. Have all your moves fit into definite plans. Don't play aimlessly.
2. When ahead in material exchange pieces whenever possible. Pawns are not considered pieces; try not to trade pawns.
3. Avoid doubled, isolated, and backward pawns.
4. In cramped positions, free yourself by exchanging.
5. Do not expose your own King while Queens are still on the board.
6. All combinations are based on double attack.
7. If your opponent has one or more pieces exposed, look for a combination.
8. To attack the King you must open a file (or less often a diagonal) to gain access for your heavy pieces (Queen and Rooks).
9. Centralize the action of all the pieces.
10. The best defense is a counterattack.


## Notes from Matt Jensen

My chess "muse".

*As white I play 1.d4 usually followed by 2.c4, pawn from g2-g3 and Bg2. As black I like to play the Caro-Kann against 1.e4 and the Semi-Slav against other openings.*

*Openings that are tactical in nature are the ones that need the most memorization. As Black the Sicilian and King's Indea defenses would be good ones. As white, playing 1.e4 tends to lead to more tactical positions. For openings that require more understanding than memorization I would look at the Torre as White and the French Defense as black.*

Matt analyzes his games, but doesn't auto-analyze with the tooling.

## My Chess Personality

This link will give some ideas of how I approach chess based on a quiz I took. Now I didn't really understand all the quiz questions, but it does list some possible openings to look at.

[Mastermind](http://www.chesspersonality.com/type/mastermind)

I've realized that I tend toward hypermodern structures when playing black (fianchettos and such) and that I do a poor job of controling the middle. I think I've also got a bad habit of putting my knights places where they constrain me more than help me.

I'm not sure if I'm more tactical or positional at this point. I know I need to understand basic tactics so that I can apply them in my games.

## Chessbase
From Matt Jensen:
```
Hi Matt,

I love Chessbase!  In the past I have tried Arena, SCID, and ChessX.  They are fine, but they are not as polished as Chessbase like you say.

The regular download is perfect:  https://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/chessbase14_download

You can add any UCI (Universal Chess Interface) engine.  I use Stockfish 8, which is open source and free to download.  I think it will come with an old version of Fritz, but just use Stockfish.  If you want to do a screen share over Skype sometime I can show you the features.  There are a ton of things you can do with Chessbase, and I barely scratch the surface myself. The main features revolve around storing/manipulating games and analysis of those games.

Happy to help if you have more questions!
