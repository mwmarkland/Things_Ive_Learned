## My Chess Personality

This link will give some ideas of how I approach chess based on a quiz I took. Now I didn't really understand all the quiz questions, but it does list some possible openings to look at.

I've realized that I tend toward hypermodern structures when playing black (fianchettos and such) and that I do a poor job of controling the middle. I think I've also got a bad habit of putting my knights places where they constrain me more than help me.

I'm not sure if I'm more tactical or positional at this point. I know I need to understand basic tactics so that I can apply them in my games.
