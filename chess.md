## Notes from Matt Jensen

My chess "muse".

*As white I play 1.d4 usually followed by 2.c4, pawn from g2-g3 and Bg2. As black I like to play the Caro-Kann against 1.e4 and the Semi-Slav against other openings.*

*Openings that are tactical in nature are the ones that need the most memorization. As Black the Sicilian and King's Indea defenses would be good ones. As white, playing 1.e4 tends to lead to more tactical positions. For openings that require more understanding than memorization I would look at the Torre as White and the French Defense as black.*

Matt analyzes his games, but doesn't auto-analyze with the tooling.

## My Chess Personality

This link will give some ideas of how I approach chess based on a quiz I took. Now I didn't really understand all the quiz questions, but it does list some possible openings to look at.

I've realized that I tend toward hypermodern structures when playing black (fianchettos and such) and that I do a poor job of controling the middle. I think I've also got a bad habit of putting my knights places where they constrain me more than help me.

I'm not sure if I'm more tactical or positional at this point. I know I need to understand basic tactics so that I can apply them in my games.

## Chessbase
From Matt Jensen:
```
Hi Matt,

I love Chessbase!  In the past I have tried Arena, SCID, and ChessX.  They are fine, but they are not as polished as Chessbase like you say.

The regular download is perfect:  https://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/chessbase14_download

You can add any UCI (Universal Chess Interface) engine.  I use Stockfish 8, which is open source and free to download.  I think it will come with an old version of Fritz, but just use Stockfish.  If you want to do a screen share over Skype sometime I can show you the features.  There are a ton of things you can do with Chessbase, and I barely scratch the surface myself. The main features revolve around storing/manipulating games and analysis of those games.

Happy to help if you have more questions!
