# Introduction

Just some facts and stuff about scikit as I figure them out. Probably
good to cross reference with other stuff too, like data science.

## KFold
[Stack Overflow Explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36063014/what-does-kfold-in-python-exactly-do#36063337)

This helps me understand what is happening when KFold is used in
conjunction with calculating a learning curve. The code parameters are a little downlevel.

## Using Keras with scikit-learn
[Link to Keras docs](https://keras.io/scikit-learn-api/)

Very interesting. Can use sequential keras models as classifier/regressor in scikit-learn tools.
