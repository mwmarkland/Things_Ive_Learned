# Acquire Eclipse.

[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org)

Click on the `Download` link.

Once you have the installer and run it, select the Eclipse version to
install. I chose `Eclipse IDE for Java Developers`.

# Add Extensions/Plugins

## From the Eclipse Marketplace

- Scala-IDE
- Maven Integration for Eclipse
- Markdown Text Editor
- PyDev

Optionally you could also add this for "advanced" TFS support:
- Team Explorer Everywhere Plugin

## Other items.
