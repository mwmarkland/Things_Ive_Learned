cmake-language(7) is the manual for the various files.

Entry point for processing is the CMakeLists.txt file in the top-level
source directory. If it does add_subdirectory() each subdirectory must
have its own CMakeLists.txt file. For each directory whose
CMakeLists.txt file is processed a corresponding directory in the
build tree is created.

Cmake generates a "build system" which is then used to build the code.
