# HOME and APPDATA

So, if you don't set something to override the HOME environment variable these are set to a default value:

HOME -- C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Roaming
APPDATA -- C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Roaming

because these directories are ensured to be available and follow you in the network.
