# Streaming frameworks.

These are things like Apache NiFi, Apache Storm, IBM Streams. What was sort of confusing for me was I had a view fo these sort of like a coordination language like Linda, but these are really things where items "drip" or "flow" through things as oppossed to tuple spaces and such. So they really don't allow for data to be processed in chunks.
