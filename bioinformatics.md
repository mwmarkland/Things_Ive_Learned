# Mate Pair (Paired End Tags)
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paired-end_tag)

"Paired-End diTags" or "ditags"

short sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of a fragment of DNA which are unique enough that they (theoretically) exist together only once in a genome, therefore making the sequence of the DNA in between them available upon search (if full-genome sequence data is available).

PET libraries have the PETs with intervening DNA absent.

A PET "represents" a larger fragment of genomic of cDNA by consisting
of a short 5' linker sequence, a short 5' sequence tag, a short 3'
sequence tag, and a short 3' linker sequence.
