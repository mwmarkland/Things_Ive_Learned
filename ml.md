## Python Libraries

### sklearn
For non-neural network learning this is the main one. Packages to train test split, metrics, etc.
Easily the most useful package (outside of pandas) for everything machine learning. Has neural network stuff also.

### PyTorch
More pythonistic. As mentioned on twitter by Dan Piponi, "You are
writing code for ML rather than code to build an AST for code for ML."
when comparing it to Tensorflow.

Described by Edward Z. Yang as "program traces" describing the work.

### Keras
Recommended (with Tensorflow as backend) to learn the general structure and flow of things. Start with the sequential method and moved into the functional API as needed. Can work in straight up Tensorflow within it to work around things.
